The purpose of this home assignment is to reconstruct averge monthly temperat- ure for Norway and Sweden during June of 2015, using observations from weather stations.

Data for the assignment is given in the file HA1 temp 2015 06.mat the file proj1 data.m provides basic commands for loading and plotting the data.
HA1 temp 2015 06.mat contains five matrices X, X valid, X grid, Y, and Y valid as well as a list of names describing the columns of the X-matrices in names, the size of the reconstruction grid in sz and borders for te plotting in Border. The columns in X, X valid, and X grid contain:
1. Longitude for each location. 2. Latitude for each location. 3. Elevation in meters.
4. Distance to closest coast.
5. Distance to the Swedish coast.
6. Distance to the Norwegian coast.
Y and Y valid contains average temperatures at stations to use in the reconstruction and for validation.
